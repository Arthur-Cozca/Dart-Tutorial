// Let's manipulate some variable
// For this first day, we will learn how to manipulate variables...

/* Let's begin! To create a variable in the Dart language, there are 2 ways: 
use the keyword "var" followed by the name of the variable and then assign its value, 
or use the type of the variable, then its name and then its value.*/

/*There are several types of values whether in the Dart or in other languages. 
There is the String type, which we will use for strings, 
the int type for integers, 
the double type for numbers with an infinity of digits after the decimal point, 
and the float type, numbers with a maximum of 2 digits after the decimal point.*/ 

/*Let's create our first helloWorld variable which will therefore have the following string type "HelloWorld! as you can see, 
this variable will have a string type. We will create it in both ways.*/
void main(){
  var helloWorld = "Hello World !";
  String HelloWorld = "HelloWorld";
}

// Let's manipulate some variable
// For this first day, we will learn how to manipulate variables...

/* Let's begin! To create a variable in the Dart language, there are 2 ways: 
use the keyword "var" followed by the name of the variable and then assign its value, 
or use the type of the variable, then its name and then its value.*/

/*There are several types of values whether in the Dart or in other languages. 
There is the String type, which we will use for strings, 
the int type for integers, 
the double type for numbers with an infinity of digits after the decimal point, 
and the float type, numbers with a maximum of 2 digits after the decimal point.*/ 

/*Let's create our first helloWorld variable which will therefore have the following string type "HelloWorld! as you can see, 
this variable will have a string type. We will create it in both ways.*/
void main(){
  var helloWorld = "Hello World !";
  String HelloWorld = "HelloWorld";
}

/*Now, let's take a look at what we just wrote. You can see that we started our program with the following line: void main() {}, 
but what is this line? This line is the main function of our program, without it, the program wouldn't work, it's like bread, without water, it doesn't work.*/
/*Now, let's take a look at what we just wrote. You can see that we started our program with the following line: void main() {}, but what is this line? This line is the main function of our program, 
without it, the program wouldn't work, it's like bread, without water, it doesn't work. 
All the code of our program will have to be in this function, otherwise, it will be the void between the sides. */

// In the next class we will look at how the conditions work with Dart. I hope this course on Dart variables will get you more! See you next week
// ps: without knowing it you now know how to make comments in Dart! It's fun, isn't it? 
// Check Out the exercice on the TP.md file

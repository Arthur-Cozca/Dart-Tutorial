# Exercice
Let's check if you have understood the concept of variable with Dart. In the following exercise you will have to complete a program<br> 
that gives certain information about a person.<br>
If your program works, you now know how to master variables like a master. See you next week<br>

Program.dart
```
void main(){
 // create here the variable
 // Name variable with name : name
 // Age variable with name : age
 // Decimal number variable with name : decimal
 // Double number variable wth name : number
 print("Hey $name, you are $age ! $decimal is not an int but $number is not a float");
}
```
